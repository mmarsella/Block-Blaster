# Block-Blaster

An HTML5 canvas game. Blast away squares slowly falling down towards your ship, if a square hits the bottom of the screen, 
you lose! Built with Javascript, HTML and CSS. Comprehension of collision detection, requestAnimationFrame and object oriented
programming is what made this game come to life!
